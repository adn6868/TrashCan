Studentsâ€™ beliefs that success in science depends on exceptional talent negatively impact their motivation
to learn. For example, such beliefs have been shown to be a major factor steering students away from
taking science and math courses in high school and college. In the present study, we tested a novel
story-based instruction that models how scientists achieve through failures and struggles. We designed
this instruction to challenge this belief, thereby improving science learning in classroom settings. A
demographically diverse group of 402 9th and 10th grade students read 1 of 3 types of stories about
eminent scientists that described how the scientists (a) struggled intellectually (e.g., made mistakes in
investigating scientific problems, and overcame the mistakes through effort), (b) struggled in their
personal life (e.g., suffered family poverty and lack of parental support but overcame it), or (c) made great
discoveries (a control condition, similar to the instructional material that appears in many science
textbooks, that did not describe any struggles). Results showed that participation in either of the struggle
story conditions improved science learning postintervention, relative to that of students in the control
condition. Additionally, the effect of our intervention was more pronounced for low-performing students.
Moreover, far more students in either of the struggle story conditions felt connected to the stories and
scientists than did students in the control condition. The use of struggle stories provides a promising and
implementable instructional approach that can improve student motivation and academic performance in
science and perhaps other subjects as well.
